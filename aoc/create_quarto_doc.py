Learned about Lagrangian Interpolation which was ...fun? In a slightly-too-small-nutshell, we
can construct a summation of polynomials, where each term goes to zero when
its corresponding x value is inputted to the function. Each term will be in
the form:

$$
\frac{\text{diff}_n}{n!}\prod_{i=1}^{n}(x - i)
$$

Where $n$ is the order of the term (constant, x, x^2 etc.) and $\text{diff}_n$ is the
difference at the correct level in the sequence of inputs. The differencing
