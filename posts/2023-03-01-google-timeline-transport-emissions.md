<p>Recently I came across this image whilst browsing instagram (their audience targeting is clearly pretty good...)</p>

<p>I've been taking trains through europe for a while now - since moving to Denmark
a year and a half ago, it's become my main method of transport for visiting the
UK. I generally spread the trains over 2 days, with an overnight in Germany.
Obviously the cost is much higher than flying,</p>

<li>Royal Soceity - to meet current levels of aviation we would need one of:<ul>
<li>Half of all agricultural land in UK to be used for biofuel</li>
<li>Double the current renewable grid capacity for hydrogen production<ul>
<li>This becomes even more challenging when you consider the increased
demand on the electricity grid from personal vehicle and home heating
electrification, which in the UK is projected to contribute to a 15%
increase in demand by 2035</li>

<ul>
<li>Flying is 2.5% of CO2 emissions (3.5% of heating when we consider other
factors). This makes the problem seem small compared to other sectors.</li>
<li>Only 20% of the world population have ever been on a plane - this 3.5% is
concentrated amongst a minority of the population</li>
<li><p>This seem like a class problem. ie. if you have the finanancial ability to get
on plane, then you could be making far better choices.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Comparison - in typical people's lifestyles, what % does flying contribution
towards their carbon footprint?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reductions towards net zero are fine if we anticipate that every other country
is trying to reach net zero at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When we look at other countries, this becomes problematic</p>
</li>
<li><p>Our quality of living in europe is contingent on an outsized amount of historic emitted co2</p>

<li>1% of global population are responsible for 50% of aviation emissions<blockquote><p>The frequent flyers identified in the study travelled about 35,000 miles
(56,000km) a year, GÃ¶ssling said, equivalent to three long-haul flights a
year, one short-haul flight per month, or some combination of the two.</p>

Being vegan for a year can save around 1 tonne of CO2 per year - which can be
eliminated by taking a single flight!</p>
